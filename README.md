## Course Description

This course focuses on basic concepts of systems analysis and simulation of the behavior of biological and physical systems. The focus is on developing mathematical representations of biological processes such as population dynamics, growth, development, diffusion, bioenergetics, and enzyme kinetics and water flow. Forrester diagrams will be developed to represent systems and aid in constructing mathematical models. Finite difference techniques for continuous system simulation will be implemented in Visual Basic for Application to simulate biological processes. Model calibration, validation and parameter estimation techniques will also be discussed.
